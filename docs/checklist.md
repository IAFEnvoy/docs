## Removed `Optifine`

`Optifine`, or `Optif**k`, is an outdated shader loader and always cause conflicts. Please use `Iris` or `Oculus` instead.

`Quilt Loader` isn't in our support list, please use `Fabric Loader` to recheck before report.

`YSM` is close source and partly written with C++. I have no idea and reason to make integration.
