## How to contribute

This documentation allows everyone to contribute with PR on GitHub. But something you need to pay attention:

1. Not all documentations are in the [main repo](https://github.com/IAFEnvoy/docs). For better permission management, part documentations are splited into other repos. Main repo will update manually every period of time.

- `Ice And Fire Community Edition`: https://github.com/IAFEnvoy/IAF-Docs
- `Avaritia Series`: https://github.com/Nova-Committee/Avaritia-Docs

2. Requirements for non-text files quote:

- Files should be as small as possible. (For example, use `webp` format for images)
- Relative paths for images and other resources are recommended.

3. If you want to long term maintenance, ask me for repo permission in GitHub or Discord.
