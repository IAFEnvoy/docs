`saturn:air`

Reads or compares the remaining air of an entity.

Checks a single entity. The condition array means all conditions must hold; these conditions are not the same as the vanilla advancement JSON player predicate.

## JSON fields

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Resource ID | yes | — | `saturn:air` |
| `comparison` | Enum string | yes | — | One of `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`. |
| `compare_to` | Number | yes | — | The target number to compare against. |

## JSON example

```json
{
  "type": "saturn:air",
  "comparison": ">=",
  "compare_to": 1
}
```

This is a value to embed in the corresponding field, not a standalone loadable data pack file. The `example:` references in the examples must be replaced with defined entries.
