`saturn:consume_health`

Consumes health from the item holder.

Operates on the item stack and its holder from the context. It is not an item definition file; embed it in a field that requires an ItemAction.

## JSON fields

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Resource ID | yes | — | `saturn:consume_health` |
| `amount` | [Number provider](../number/index.md) | yes | — | Amount or value; a number provider may be a number, a formula string or an object with a type. |

## JSON example

```json
{
  "type": "saturn:consume_health",
  "amount": 1

This is a value to embed in the corresponding field, not a standalone loadable data pack file. The `example:` references in the examples must be replaced with defined entries.
